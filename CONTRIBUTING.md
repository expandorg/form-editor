## Types of contributions we're looking for

There are many ways you can directly contribute to the guides (in descending order of need):

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- suggesting enhancements

## How Can I Contribute?

### Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/expandorg/form-editor/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy! Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Suggesting Enhancements
How Do I Submit A Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub [issues](https://github.com/expandorg/form-editor/issues). Create an issue on this repository and provide the following information:

- Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.

## Setting up your environment

Clone the repository with: 

`git clone git@github.com:expandorg/form-editor.git`


### Tests
```yarn run tests```

## Pull Requests
We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
